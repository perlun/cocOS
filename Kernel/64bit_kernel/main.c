    // Alright. We are now in 64-bit mode. However, for the moment only the lowest 2 megs of RAM are properly 1-to-1 mapped
    // (identity mapped), and can be accessed. This is set up in the 64-bit initialization code in the 32-bit
    // loader. (64bit.S) Now, it is time to create real VM structure (PML4, Page Directory Pointers and Page Tables) for
    // all the physical memory.

    // There is only one little problem: the physical memory size is located in the Multiboot structure, which can be placed
    // anywere in RAM, and thus be inaccessible to us. We solve it by having it provided to us as a parameter to this
    // function: upper_memory_limit. This parameter gives us the total amount of memory in the system. By using this
    // parameter, we know how much physical memory to map in the lower VM zone (see the cocOS VM Specification for more
    // information about the VM zones). When this memory is mapped, we can then read the Multiboot memory map once again to
    // know which pages to flag as usable and which ones that are reserved by hardware.
